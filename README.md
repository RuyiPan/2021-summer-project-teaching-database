# Summer Research Project -- Statistical Education Resources
This project aims to make instructors easily find statistical education news for teaching and help students leadn more applied examples. We constrcted an open database, desgined a website for domenostration, and included some basic data analysis.

## [Database](https://github.com/RuyiPan/2021-summer-project-teaching-database/tree/main/Dataset)
We collected news which appeared in the professor Nancy Reid's past statstics courses, and gathered important features of news to construct our own database.


## [Descriptive Analysis](https://github.com/RuyiPan/2021-summer-project-teaching-database/tree/main/Code/Descriptive_Analysis)
Using barplots to show distribution of statstical concepts/scientific fields in the news. 
Using word cloud to show the occurrence of concepts
Using treemap and connected plot to show the relationship between general concepts and specific concepts

## [Classification Analysis](https://github.com/RuyiPan/2021-summer-project-teaching-database/tree/main/Code/Multi-classification_Analysis)
- Ordinal regression analysis
- Decision Tree Classification Model
- K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifiers

## Website
We use R shiny to bulid our website to show our database and some analysis we have done.

## [Auto-filling](https://github.com/RuyiPan/2021-summer-project-teaching-database/tree/main/Code/Data_Auto-filling)
This part results in not impressive. However, we also include in here to give some motivations about auto-filling features os news.
