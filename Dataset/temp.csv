9,199,2014-11-11,The rise of Mean World Syndrome,The Canadian Press,Peter Nowak,2014-11-06,psychology,NA,"1. In June, Facebook drew heavy criticism for revealing an “emotional contagion” experiment it had conducted
on about 700,000 users. The website reduced the number of positive posts some users saw, which resulted
in those people producing fewer upbeat and more negative expressions. The reverse also held true when
researchers reduced the number of negative posts visible.
2. Another study from the University of California in San Diego, published in Public Library of Science One
in March, found that something as simple as mentions of rainfall on Facebook affected other users’ moods
negatively.
3. A recent study from John Hopkins University
in Baltimore suggests it is possible to use Twitter as a proactive diagnosis tool for potential mental health
issues, including post-traumatic stress, depression and seasonal affective disorder. Language recognition
software can study the words people use and thus gauge their mental states and moods.","There are some who feel more than just a personal connection to a news event, for whom triggering posttraumatic
stress disorder is a very real possibility. While traditional media like newspaper and television
generally give advance warning when certain contact may act as triggers, social media exchanges lack any
such cautions.
Fortunately, what the medium takes away, it can also give back.","For those who simply can’t tear themselves away, Rutledge suggests seeking out content that can counter
some of the crushing weight of digesting traumatic events, and of Mean World Syndrome. There’s no shortage
of positivity to consume. “You can remind yourself that there’s a lot of humanity that’s joyful and exuberant,”
she says.",Experimental design,Correlation,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/relationships/the-rise-of-mean-world-syndrome-in-social-media/article21481089/,NA,NA,NA,,

called AdNauseam will launch next week at the Digital Labor conference at the New School in New York.
The idea: Advertisers want our data? Let’s give them bad data. The program works in the background of a
Web browser, clicking on ads indiscriminately and boggling the information that ad networks collect.","It’s really hard to understand the age of data that we’re stepping into.

11,199,2014-11-11,Will MOOCs be Flukes?,The New Yorker,Maria Konnikova,2014-11-07,Education,NA,"On July 23rd, 1969, Geoffrey Crowther addressed the inaugural meeting of the Open University, a British
institution that had just been created to provide an alternative to traditional higher education. Courses would
be conducted by mail and live radio. The basic mission, Crowther declared, was a simple one: to be open to
people from all walks of life. “The first, and most urgent task before us is to cater for the many thousands of
people, fully capable of a higher education, who, for one reason or another, do not get it, or do not get as
much of it as they can turn to advantage, or as they discover, sometimes too late, that they need,” he told his
audience. “Men and women drop out through failures in the system,” he continued, “through disadvantages
of their environment, through mistakes of their own judgment, through sheer bad luck. These are our primary
material.” He then invoked the message emblazoned on the Statue of Liberty: Open University wanted the
tired, the poor, the huddled masses. To them, most of all, it opened its doors.","1. Those who succeeded in the mooc were those who had already succeeded academically.
2. Even students who succeed in traditional classrooms can get lost in the mooc shuffle.","Moocs are a technology with potentially revolutionary implications for education, but without
a precise plan for realizing that potential. One way of getting there could be for the leaders of the mooc
movement to look more closely at old methods, from when education was less massive, less open, and entirely
offline.",Statistics,"Completion rate, Pass rate",https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions,NA,NA,NA,,
12,199,2014-11-25,A Persuasive Chart Showing How Persuasive Charts Are,New York Times,Justin Wolfers,2014-11-24,Statistics/ Visualization,NA,"A large pharmaceutical company has recently developed a new drug to boost peoples’ immune function. It reports that trials it conducted demonstrated a drop of 40 percent (from 87 to 47 percent) in occurrence of the common cold. It intends to market the new drug as soon as next winter, following F.D.A. approval.Then for a randomly selected subsample, the researchers supplemented the description of the drug trial with a simple chart. But here’s the kicker: That chart contained no new information; it simply repeated the information in the original vignette, with a tall bar illustrating that 87 percent of the control group had the illness, and a shorter bar showing that that number fell to 47 percent for those who took the drug.
","When this was the only information given, 68 percent believed that the medication really did reduce illness.But taking the same information and also showing it as a chart made it enormously more persuasive, raising the proportion who believed in the efficacy of the drug to 97 percent from 68 percent.","The researchers conjecture, charts offer the veneer of science. And indeed, the tendency to find the charts more persuasive was strongest among those who agreed with the statement “I believe in science.”",Experimental design,randomized controlled trial,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/upshot/a-persuasive-chart-showing-how-persuasive-charts-are.html?abt=0002&abg=0,NA,NA,NA,,
13,199,2014-11-25,Diamond Ring Pricing Using Linear Regression,Straits Times,Chu Singfat,1992-02-29,Business,NA,"Students find it reasonable to assume that they are dealing with ""commercial grade"" jewelry intended
for the mass market. Such jewelry is similar in terms of design, gold weight, and the diamond qualities
of cut, colour, and clarity. Therefore, the carat size of the diamond stones becomes the obvious factor to
use in pricing the rings.","Examination of a scatter plot of the data suggests the viability of a simple linear regression (SLR)
model.The fitted regression model is Estimated price = -259.63 + 3721.02 (carats). The fit
is excellent as indicated by an R² of 0.978. The t-statistics for the intercept and slope coefficients are -
14.99 and 45.50, respectively.Students invariably employ an SLR model. They also perform residual analysis, and, finding nothing
unusual, they are satisfied with the regression fit.","This paper illustrates model-building in linear regression. It is shown that a possibly counter-intuitive
negative intercept may be avoided by using a multiplicative or exponential regression model. These
regression models are intrinsically linear, and they are estimated using standard linear regression
technology after a suitable transformation of the data.",Regression,Simple Linear Regression,https://voxeu.org/article/fair-shares-pledged-carbon-cuts,NA,NA,NA,,
14,199,2014-11-25,A pre-Lima scorecard for evaluating which countries are doing their fair share in pledged carbon cuts,Paper,"Valentina Bosetti, Jeffrey Frankel",2014-11-24,Climate,NA,"Consider the most recent developments in what targets countries have unilaterally pledged, heading into the Lima Summit. We use economic/climate models to translate pledges into common terms of emission tons and to estimate BAU (Hof et al. 2013). (Some countries express their numerical targets in terms of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, some relative to emissions in particular years, and some relative to their GDPs.)","Figure 1 plots countries’ pledged emission cuts against their incomes so that we can judge progressivity. The vertical axis shows cuts in emissions, expressed relative to a particular baseline. The baseline is the simple average of the country’s actual 2005 emission and the 2020 BAU emission level. This baseline makes some allowance for the reality of rapid growth, particularly in developing countries, while pulling everyone partway back in the direction of 2005 levels. A statistical estimate of the ‘latecomer catch-up factor’ embodied in the targets is .51, highly significant and remarkably close to .50. This justifies the use of the simple average in constructing the base line. The current targets have a base year of 2005 rather than 1990. Many countries now choose explicitly to express their targets as percentage cuts from their 2005 levels. But more important is the finding, for the overall sample of countries, that the 2005 number shows up as highly significant in an unconstrained regression and that the 1990 number is no longer at all significant. Evidently too much time has passed since 1990 and it is no longer treated as part of the relevant baseline
The horizontal axis in Figure 1 is the country’s income per capita in 2010 (on a log scale). The slope of the line corresponds remarkably well to earlier estimates on earlier data – each 10.0% increase in income is associated with a 1.4% more ambitious cut on average. The line generally fits the points, reflecting the fact that the relationship is highly significant statistically. The fit provides encouragement that countries are again implicitly operating according to notions of fairness similar to what we have hypothesised.","1.	It is possible to quantify fairness;
2.	The emission targets that have been offered by most countries going into Lima correspond relatively well to the ‘fairness’ relationship; and
3.	This judgment includes China and the US, without whose serious participation little progress is possible.",Regression,Simple Linear Regression,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.1996.11910519,NA,NA,NA,,
